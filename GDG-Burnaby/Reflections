🚀 DevFestBBY 2023: A Tale of 2 Venues - Tech, Passion, Food, Water-tight Agenda, Networking Nirvana and Fun! 🌟 #DevFestBBY #CommunityWins

🎬 Lights, Camera, Action! Our DevFest 2023 unfolded like a blockbuster— filled with unexpected twists, laughter, and learning moments, much like the movie "Accepted." From doubting speaker availability (I was planning to speak half a day should I not get speakers or should no one respond to me!) to closing the Call for Proposals 3 weeks earlier than planned because I could not click Decline or say NO, this journey has been exhilarating! 🎥

🌐 Beyond Technology: Our event wasn't just about bytes and codes; it was a melting pot of passion, collaboration, and breaking barriers. Witnessing technology leaders, developers, and startups come together was akin to creating our higher learning institution—full of creativity, inspiration, and opportunities for everyone involved. 🌈

🙋‍♀️ A special mention to Uttam Tripathi, whose succinct yes two weeks after the chapter was incorporated and how I seized that moment and published his poster!
Uttam, I knew you had to travel during the US Thanksgiving holiday to meet your 🍁 community, and I owe your family and friends a heartfelt sorry.

👨‍🏫YK Sugi, thank you for accepting my invitation to do the closing keynote after our online call; my son's unexpected appearance on stage 🤦‍♀️and your adapting to that energy was a masterstroke.

🙏Great introductions and support by Toki from Vancouver.dev, Sobhana, who would leave voice notes and constantly surprise me with partnership and introductions; 
🤲Khristine, Nadine, ChengCheng, Dennis, Weber and Chris, for facilitating and moderating world-class panels, to our top-notch speakers who humbly accepted my invitation via our CFP and messages via LinkedIn, trusting our abilities. 

🤖 From Product to Public Speaking, Personal Branding to the Power of One, Thought-provoking panels to Transformation Skills, from AI to Andriod, Cybersecurity to Conscious Leadership to Code, Coffee and Kids, building Networks to increasing Net Worth, Improv Speaking to Ideating Products in the era of GenAI, we had it all. Our event had something for everyone! 
📚 Coffee, connections, and captivating panels added to the flavour. 
💪 My incredible co-organizers, Rajat and Jacky, you all made it possible.

💚Posters, memes, emojis, and fun facts brought the fun side of speakers and acted as icebreakers for the audience. Before anyone can take back their words, posters would have been made!

🙌 Partnerships and Dreams: Organizing #DevFestBBY alongside Women Techmakers was a dream fulfilled. A massive shoutout to Junnet Ali and Corinna for going above and beyond regarding budget 💹needs and surprising us with some last-minute additions! 😋

🍔 From Lunches to Learnings: Lunches with leaders, leading their cohort and providing mentorship to their group! Great conversations happen over food.

🙏 Gratitude Overflow: Huge thanks to my co-organizers Rajat and Jacky, our fantastic speakers, mentors like Mike Hoff, venue sponsors, and the entire team behind the scenes—each of you 
completed this intricate puzzle of success. 🧩

🙏 Team Appreciation: To my dedicated team, you are my heroes. Our late-night brainstorming sessions, unwavering support, shared laughter, our arguments, and our agreement to disagree turned this wild ride into a cherished memory. 🌈

🤹Our incredible  GDG NorthAmerica mentor Mike Hoff, who helped run the show and kept me sane, got swags, our expert GDEs 🎓 who travelled far and wide to come to speak at the event and share their expertise, our fantastic venue sponsors Northeastern University 🌃, which has start-of-the-art facilities, Ruby, Sapphire, Knowledge Sponsors and facilitators, take a bow. 
💚Emma, we loved the cute Grammarly socks 🧦 thank you for sending me a big stash! 
🍒 Here's to more partnerships, increased knowledge, better food, Coffee galore, swags, and more partnerships! 🌟

🧩 We could not have done it without you, and each of you came as a piece of a jigsaw puzzle and completed this complex puzzle.

🌟 Diversity Triumph: Celebrating over 220 registrations was surreal. The fact that 30% identified as women and over 2% as non-binary was a triumph for our shared commitment to representation. Our collective efforts are making waves, and I'm grateful to be part of this change!🌊

🎤 Speakers, take a bow 🙇‍♀️: A big shoutout to our speakers. Your knowledge and passion not only upgraded the skills of our community but also added a special touch. You are the driving force of the event 🚀
I Hope you loved the cute cards and cherish them. 🗃️

🎁ChengCheng for coordinating with Junnet and agreeing to moderate the WTM panel and get me goodies; my mentor Mike Hoff, who supported me when I ran into a roadblock; and Dinuka, who accommodated every request at the venue and consoled me when I broke down feeling overwhelmed, thank you for being there. All brickbats and bouquets were noted from feedback, and we will strive to improve.

👏 Cheers to Volunteers: GDGBBY's heartbeat lies in its unsung hero volunteers—your commitment made the magic happen, and we eagerly anticipate more collaborations ahead! 🌟

👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 Apologies and Gratitude: To my family, especially my little one, for barely doing anything on their birthday, apologies for not being able to celebrate as planned. To friends, mentors, and supporters who stood by me—your unwavering support means the world while I was running into health issues and anxiously waiting on my biopsy results and bloodwork report. 🌍

If there's one word I want to leave you with, it is "glocal." Let's strive for a "glocal" impact—let our global efforts reverberate in our local communities. This word encapsulates our DevFest journey, just like in the movie "Up in the Air." 🌍✨ #GlocalImpact

🎉 Winston Churchill once said: "This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning." 

Ready? Set. Deploy! 🚀
