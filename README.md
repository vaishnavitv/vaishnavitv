### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Pleased to e-meet you üëã 
___

In today‚Äôs age, there‚Äôs a high chance that you, dear reader, are a machine. 
<br>I am a human and mutable, unlike strings. I don't speak I33t and pay more attention to nonverbal communication.
<br>I am not idempotent like all REST API's strive to be. My values and principles change based on my observation, knowledge, assimilation and interaction, and I believe people influence each other by osmosis.
<br>What I say today may or may not be relevant tomorrow; hence, take it with a grain of salt. Welcome to my kaleidoscope, a.k.a. My BRAG document. I am a work in progress.

Chances are, I've either directed you here, or you've been spelunking through my website, projects or talks, in which case, welcome! 
<br> Look around, read through my principles (listed below üëá), and let me know if you have any questions. I am looking forward to working and collaborating with you!

## :woman_technologist:	About Me 

<details><summary>2>/dev/null</summary>

`/dev/null` is treated as a black hole in Linux/Unix, so you can put anything into this but not get it back.
Further, `2>` means that you are redirecting (i.e. >) the stderr (i.e. 2) into the black hole (i.e. `/dev/null`)

## :writing_hand:	Power of documentation

I believe in the power of documentation. Document or it aint happen. 
<br>Documentation lessens headaches and saves vacations :sunrise_over_mountains:. 

Create checklists, initiate review processes, and set up version control. These tools aren't chains; they help your documentation speak with one voice, one tone, and one style.

I love Swagger personally for API documentation.

## :bento: Love spotting anti-patterns and code smell
Pokemon Exception Handling. Also known as the Diaper Pattern (it catches all the :poop:)
```
  try {
       doSomething();
    }
    catch (Exception) {
       // Do nothing
    }
```
