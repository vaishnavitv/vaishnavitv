## :man_technologist:	About Me

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for working collaboratively and promoting DEI, neurodiversity and accessibility. I firmly believe that by breaking down silos and encouraging open communication,teams can achieve great things together. I understand the importance of creating empathetic products and services that can be used by people of all abilities and  constantly seeking ways to incorporate this mindset into my work.
