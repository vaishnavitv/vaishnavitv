## :woman_technologist:	About Me

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for working collaboratively and a champion for DEI, neurodiversity and accessibility. I firmly believe that by breaking down silos and encouraging open communication, teams can achieve great things together. I understand the importance of creating empathetic products and services that can be used by people of all abilities and constantly seeking ways to incorporate this mindset into my work.

I am passionate about how to improve ways of working and increase the speed of business by accelerating value delivery and through visual communication.

I am currently an ambassador for Google Women TechMaker (WTM) program, Drawify and Grammarly. I use my voice to bring represenation in product and tech in all the platforms.

## 🔭 Principles I believe in

:revolving_hearts: Dedicate myself to creating software that is accessible and usable for individuals with a wide range of cognitive and neurological differences with utmost commitment.

:muscle: Make it a top priority to use clear and concise language in all communication, both written and verbal, without any exceptions whatsoever.

:star: Cultivate an environment of inclusivity and acceptance that leaves no one feeling undervalued or disrespected under any circumstances.

## :writing_hand:	Power of documentation

I believe in the power of documentation. If it is not documented it is not there. 
I love Swagger for API documentaion.
