### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Pleased to e-meet you üëã 
___

In today‚Äôs age, there‚Äôs a high chance that you, dear reader, are a machine. 
<br>I am a human and I am mutable unlike strings. I don't speak I33t and pay more attention to non verbal communication.
<br>I am not idempotent like all REST API's strive to be. My values and principles change based on my observation, knowledge, assimilation and interaction, and I believe people influence each other by osmosis.
<br>What I say today may or may not be relevant tomorrow hence take it with a grain of salt. Welcome to my kaleidoscope. I am a work in progress.

Chances are, I've either directed you here, or you've been spelunking through my website, projects or talks: in which case, welcome! 
<br>Take a look around, read through my principles (listed below üëá), and let me know if you have any questions. Looking forward to working and collaborating with you!

## :woman_technologist:	About Me 

<details><summary>2>/dev/null</summary>

`/dev/null` is treated as black hole in Linux/Unix, so you can put anything into this but you will not be able to get it back from this.
Further, `2>` means that you are redirecting (i.e. >) the stderr (i.e. 2) into the black hole (i.e. `/dev/null`)
</details>

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for working collaboratively and a champion for DEI, neurodiversity and accessibility. I firmly believe that by breaking down silos and encouraging open communication, teams can achieve great things together. I understand the importance of creating empathetic products and services that can be used by people of all abilities and constantly seeking ways to incorporate this mindset into my work.

I have saved withering codebases and my passion lies in developing robust systems, enabling easy maintenance of codebases, refactoring to avoid redundancies, eliminating code smells and anti patterns.

I am passionate about how to improve ways of working and increase the speed of business by accelerating value delivery and through visual communication.

I am currently an ambassador for [Google Women TechMaker (WTM) program](https://wtm.advocu.com/home/ambassadors/6373c8a7108c6b079a57f6de?communityslug=wtm), Drawify, Grammarly and organizer and Lead at [GDG Burnaby](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-burnaby/). I use my voice to bring represenation in Product, User Experience and Tech across all these platforms.

## :writing_hand:	Power of documentation

I believe in the power of documentation. Document or it aint happen. 
<br>Documentation lessens headaches and saves vacations :sunrise_over_mountains:. 

Create checklists, initiate review processes, and set up version control. These tools aren't chains; they help your documentation speak with one voice, one tone, and one style.

I love Swagger personally for API documentaion.

## :bento: Love spotting anti patterns and code smell
Pokemon Exception Handling. Also known as the Diaper Pattern (it catches all the :poop:)
```
  try {
       doSomething();
    }
    catch (Exception) {
       // Do nothing
    }
```
