## :writing_hand:	Power of documentation

I believe in the power of documentation. Document or it aint happen. 
I love Swagger for API documentaion. 
Documentation lessens headaches and saves vacations. 

Create checklists, initiate review processes, and set up version control. These tools aren't chains; they help your documentation speak with one voice, one tone, and one style. Source : [Proper-Documentation](https://vadimkravcenko.com/shorts/proper-documentation/)
