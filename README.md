## :man_technologist:	About Me

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for working collaboratively and a champion for DEI, neurodiversity and accessibility. I firmly believe that by breaking down silos and encouraging open communication, teams can achieve great things together. I understand the importance of creating empathetic products and services that can be used by people of all abilities and constantly seeking ways to incorporate this mindset into my work.

I am passionate about how to improve ways of working and increase the speed of business by accelerating value delivery and through visual communication.

## Principles I believe in

:revolving_hearts: Dedicate myself to creating software that is accessible and usable for individuals with a wide range of cognitive and neurological differences with utmost commitment.

:muscle: Make it a top priority to use clear and concise language in all communication, both written and verbal, without any exceptions whatsoever.

:star: Cultivate an environment of inclusivity and acceptance that leaves no one feeling undervalued or disrespected under any circumstances.

:herb: Insist on open communication and active listening so that every team member feels heard and understood without question.

:telescope: Continuously educate myself and the team on the unique needs and strengths of neurodivergent individuals with unyielding determination.

:trophy: Foster a sense of community and support, both within your team and with the wider neurodivergent community, without any exceptions whatsoever with full conviction.

:rotating_light: Take a stand for, and implement universal design principles in all software development without compromise with full confidence.

:checkered_flag: Encourage experimentation and creativity that allows for varied perspectives and approaches to problem-solving, without any restrictions whatsoever.

:writing_hand:	Power of documentation
---
I believe in the power of documentation. If it is not documented it is not there. 
I love Swagger for API documentaion.
